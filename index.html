			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Emin Martirosyan. I'm a bilingual Armenian-American born and raised in Burbank, CA. I am an experienced professional with a diverse work history in the corporate world. I've held various leadership roles at multiple organizations and have established myself as a skilled business executive. In addition to working for several companies, I has also served as a CEO of a structural steel company, where my team successfully led the organization through a period of growth and expansion. Throughout my career, I've always demonstrated a strong ability to drive business results through strategic planning, effective communication, and a commitment to excellence. 
        <p>
            Now I will become a highly skilled Full Stack Developer with an extensive background in software development. A Full Stack Developer is someone who is proficient in both front-end and back-end web development, meaning they have a thorough understanding of all layers of a web application, from server-side logic and database management to client-side scripting and user interface design. By the end of the course, i will have a deep understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. With a passion for problem-solving, creativity, and innovation, I am always up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in software development, making them a valuable asset to any team or organization.
            </p>
			<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me spending time with my family, attending sporting events, playing piano, playing video games or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.</p>

					<h3>Project 1: Horiseon Code Refactor
                    </h3>
					<p>In this project, we begin by receiving code to a running website. A marketing agency would like me to modify their current website to meet accessibility standards optimal for search engines. In this project, I viewed the source code and found semantic HTML elements to find a better structure of styling and positioning and meet the agency's needs. Refactoring existing code consists of taking someone's code and improving it without changing it's functionality. I created a new header with functional tabs, change elements to follow a more fluid structure by changing styling and positioning and find accessible alternative attributes.</p>
