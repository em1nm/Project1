            <p>
                My name is Emin Martirosyan. I'm a bilingual Armenian-American born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. I am an experienced professional with a diverse work history in the corporate world. I've held various leadership roles at multiple organizations and have established myself as a skilled business executive. In addition to working for several companies, I has also served as a CEO at a structural steel company, where my team successfully led the organization through a period of growth and expansion. Throughout my career, I've always demonstrated a strong ability to drive business results through strategic planning, effective communication, and a commitment to excellence. 
      
                Now I will become a highly skilled Full Stack Developer with an extensive background in software development. A Full Stack Developer is someone who is proficient in both front-end and back-end web development, meaning they have a thorough understanding of all layers of a web application, from server-side logic and database management to client-side scripting and user interface design. By the end of the course, i will have a deep understanding of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc. With a passion for problem-solving, creativity, and innovation, I am always up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in software development, making them a valuable asset to any team or organization.
