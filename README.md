ReadMe.md Project 1: Emin Martirosyan's Portfolio

## Description 
Creating a portfolio HTML is an essential step for showcasing your skills and work to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. It's a way of highlighting your achievements and providing evidence of your abilities. A portfolio HTML should be a carefully crafted and visually appealing representation of your work, skills, and experience.

The first step in creating my portfolio HTML was to choose a design that reflects my style and personality. Essentially, for me, that means black and white. It's important to choose a design that is clean, easy to navigate, and visually appealing. A cluttered and confusing design can steer away potential employers or clients.

Next, I gathered all the content I wanted to include in my portfolio. This includes examples of my work, design projects, or coding projects, as well as any relevant information about my work experience, skills and personal life.

Once I have gathered my design and content, it's time to start building my portfolio HTML. I created this portfolio using a variety of tools such as HTML and CSS. It's important to make sure that your portfolio is responsive and mobile-friendly so that it can be viewed on a variety of devices.

In summary, creating a portfolio HTML is an essential step in showcasing your skills and work to potential employers or clients. By choosing a design that reflects your style, organizing your content effectively, and thoroughly testing your portfolio before publishing it, you can create a professional and effective portfolio that highlights your achievements and abilities.
